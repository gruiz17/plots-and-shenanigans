<h2>Who Built This?</h2>
<p>I'm Gabriel Ruiz. I'm a developer from UC Berkeley. I also do mathy things and dance.</p>
<p>All my other projects are located <a href="http://github.com/gruiz17">here on my GitHub.</a></p>
<p>If you look at my commit times, you'll see that I have no idea where I put my sleep schedule. I think it's somewhere in my high school...</p>
