Plots and Shenanigans
=====================

A collection of small visuals I made with d3.js based on some datasets I currently have.

Datasets included:

* [Frequency of different words in description of Y-Combinator companies](https://github.com/gruiz17/ycscraper/blob/master/data_files/wordcount_sorted.csv) - scraped from http://yclist.com
* [List of every inmate executed in Texas since 1982](https://github.com/gruiz17/deathrow/blob/master/deathrow.csv) - scraped from http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html
